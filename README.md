Latest Typescript and Node - as bare-bone as possible example app

I wanted to start a simple Node project where I can insstall the latest things I want and couldn't find a simple bare bone example, so maybe that would help someone.

I've commited the dist folder as well to see how the output from Typescript.

Would love suggestions on how to make it better or to point to a better example!
